Black Lives Matter
==================

Self-education information for privileged white Americans like myself.

_Historical research has shown that the idea of "race" has always
carried more meanings than mere physical differences; indeed,
physical variations in the human species have no meaning except the
social ones that humans put on them. Today scholars in many fields
argue that "race" as it is understood in the United States of
America was a social mechanism invented during the 18th century to
refer to those populations brought together in colonial America: the
English and other European settlers, the conquered Indian peoples,
and those peoples of Africa brought in to provide slave labor._

_It was freedom fighter Angela Y. Davis who said, “In a racist society
it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” And, there
are important differences between non-racism and anti-racism. To be
non-racist is to simply abstain from participation in racist beliefs
or actions. It is the decision not to participate in racist ideas
about others. That’s it. It has no social component. No manifestation
within one’s social networks. It’s a laissez-faire political attitude
on race that might prevent further harm, but does nothing to repair
existing damage._

_To be anti-racist is to actively work toward the eradication of racism
wherever it exists. Anti-racism requires intention and
disruption. Anti-racist work is not done quietly nor is it performed
only once. Anti-racist work is more than Facebook posts and Twitter
threads. Being anti-racist is about putting one’s self at personal
risk so that the risk for Black people is reduced._

_Racism is litigated over and over again when another video depicting
another atrocity comes to light. Black people share the truth of their
lives, and white people treat those truths as intellectual exercises._

_They put energy into being outraged about the name "Karen," as
shorthand for entitled white women rather than doing the difficult,
self-reflective work of examining their own prejudices. They speculate
about what murdered black people might have done that we don't know
about to beget their fates, as if alleged crimes are punishable by
death without a trial by jury. They demand perfection as the price for
black existence while harboring no such standards for anyone else._

_Some white people act as if there are two sides to racism, as if
racists are people we need to reason with. They fret over the
destruction of property and want everyone to just get along. They
struggle to understand why black people are rioting but offer no
alternatives about what a people should do about a lifetime of rage,
disempowerment and injustice._
