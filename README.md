Black Lives Matter
==================

Self-education information for privileged white Americans like myself.

_It was freedom fighter Angela Y. Davis who said, “In a racist society
it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” And, there
are important differences between non-racism and anti-racism. To be
non-racist is to simply abstain from participation in racist beliefs
or actions. It is the decision not to participate in racist ideas
about others. That’s it. It has no social component. No manifestation
within one’s social networks. It’s a laissez-faire political attitude
on race that might prevent further harm, but does nothing to repair
existing damage._

_To be anti-racist is to actively work toward the eradication of racism
wherever it exists. Anti-racism requires intention and
disruption. Anti-racist work is not done quietly nor is it performed
only once. Anti-racist work is more than Facebook posts and Twitter
threads. Being anti-racist is about putting one’s self at personal
risk so that the risk for Black people is reduced._
