Mississippi Goddam (1964)
=========================

Captured 8 Jun 2020 (56 years after this call to action, still no
action, still black lives dying in American streets)

This song was first performed and recorded at Carnegie Hall in 1964, a
turbulent year in the Civil Rights struggle.

The prominent repetition of the phrase “do it slow” in the refrain
refers to political moderates encouraging the civil rights movement to
move slowly, which Nina is ridiculing here.

The song was written in under an hour and recorded live at Carnegie
Hall. It was later pressed into a single, which was banned in large
portions of the country, ostensibly because of the word ‘Goddam’ in
the title. Boxes of records were destroyed in some places. This is
documented in the biopic What Happened, Miss Simone?

The release of Mississippi Goddam marked a point in Nina Simone’s
career where she became increasingly active in the civil rights
movement and her professional career suffered, likely as a direct
result.

[Spoken Introduction]
The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam
And I mean every word of it

[Verse 1]
Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

Can't you see it
Can't you feel it
It's all in the air
I can't stand the pressure much longer
Somebody say a prayer

[Chorus]
Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

(This is a show tune, but the show hasn't been written for it, yet)

[Verse 2]
Hound dogs on my trail
School children sitting in jail
Black cat cross my path
I think every day's gonna be my last

Lord have mercy on this land of mine
We all gonna get it in due time
I don't belong here
I don't belong there
I've even stopped believing in prayer

Don't tell me, I'll tell you
Me and my people just about due
I've been there so I know
They keep on saying "Go slow!"

[Refrain]
But that's just the trouble
"do it slow"
Washing the windows
"do it slow"
Picking the cotton
"do it slow"
You're just plain rotten
"do it slow"
You're too damn lazy
"do it slow"
The thinking's crazy
"do it slow"
Where am I going
What am I doing
I don't know
I don't know

Just try to do your very best
Stand up, be counted with all the rest
For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

(I bet you thought I was kidding, didn't you)

[Verse 3]
Picket lines, school boycotts
They try to say it's a communist plot
All I want is equality
For my sister, my brother, my people, and me

Yes, you lied to me all these years
You told me to wash and clean my ears
And talk real fine just like a lady
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie

Oh but this whole country is full of lies
You're all gonna die and die like flies
I don't trust you any more
You keep on saying "Go slow!"
"Go slow!"

[Refrain]
But that's just the trouble
"do it slow"
Desegregation
"do it slow"
Mass participation
"do it slow"
Reunification
"do it slow"
Do things gradually
"do it slow"
But bring more tragedy
"do it slow"
Why don't you see it
Why don't you feel it
I don't know
I don't know

[Chorus]
You don't have to live next to me
Just give me my equality
Everybody knows about Mississippi
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

[Spoken Outro]
That's it!
