Segments in this Video

* Voices of Eighteenth Century Slaves (03:54)
  Modern technology resurrects the voices and memories of
  ex-slaves. Former slaves describe living in bondage and being sold at
  auction like animals.
* Laura Smalley Remembers Abuse (04:36)
  Laura Smalley, a 91-year-old former slave, is recorded by folklorists
  in the 1940s. She describes the whipping and burning of a female slave
  who has an argument with a white woman.
* Conditions Vary for Slaves (03:29)
  Harriet Smith had a home similar to her master's and attended his
  church but at different times. Smalley and Fountain Hughes remember
  slaves being whipped for praying and the relentless work.
* Leaving One Hell for Another (03:27)
  Cotton farmers devise an elaborate "pass system" which require slaves
  to carry a permission note. When emancipation comes, ex-slaves have to
  provide for themselves in a war-devastated South.
* Folklorists Provide Slave Narratives (05:19)
  During the 1930s while gathering African-American folk traditions,
  John Henry Faulk, the Lomaxes, and Zora Neal Hurston make the ex-slave
  audio tapes. Ironically, freedom is born in slaveholding societies.

> "This reproduction of an ABC Nightline News program, hosted by Ted
> Koppel, brings to life actual voices and memories of slaves through
> now digitally remastered tapes originally recorded in the 1930s and
> 1940s. Thousands of interviews with ex-slaves were conducted by John
> Henry Falke, Zora Neale Hurston, and other folklorists. Most of them
> were written down and published in pamphlets and some were recorded
> by phonographs. These tapes have been cleaned up with the newest
> computer technology, which results in remarkable audibility. One of
> the voices belongs to 101-year-old Fountain Hugh who was born in
> 1848 into slavery and was a grandson of a slave owned by Thomas
> Jefferson. Slave narratives like his describe treacherous and harsh
> living conditions under bondage and after emancipation. For the
> study of history instruction, gaining the knowledge of primary
> sources is valuable. Slave narratives serve as rich primary source
> material. This program does an excellent job of informing the
> viewers of the possibilities of using narrative as a primary
> source. However, this short program does not and cannot possibly
> provide sufficient accounts of slavery. Viewers will benefit from
> reading printed slave narratives in addition to watching this
> program."  —Electronic Magazine of Multicultural Education

> How did it feel to be bought and sold like cattle, only to be
> liberated with nowhere to go and no one to turn to for help? In this
> profoundly moving program, Ted Koppel of ABC News presents the
> African-American slave experience in the voices of those who knew it
> firsthand. Thanks to tapes—now digitally remastered—from a project
> undertaken during the 1930s and 40s by John Henry Falke and others,
> 101-year-old Fountain Hughes, who was born in 1848, and other
> ex-slaves give their recollections of life before Emancipation and
> during Reconstruction.
