Using interviews and footage from his public speeches, as well as a
terrific voiceover narrator (James Earl Jones), this documentary
brings to life the history, philosophy and legacy of civil rights
leader Malcolm X. The filmmakers show how spirituality helped inform
Malcolm's belief that African-Americans needed to decide their own
destiny. Meanwhile, interviews with other noteworthy figures during
the civil rights movement help place the famed leader in context with
his time.
