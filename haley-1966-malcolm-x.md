This is the absorbing personal story of the man who rose from hoodlum,
thief, dope peddler, and pimp to become the most dynamic leader of the
Black Revolution. It is, too, a testament of great emotional power
from which every American can learn much. But, above all, this book
shows the Malcolm X that very few people knew, the man behind the
stereotyped image of the hate-preacher—a sensitive, proud, highly
intelligent man whose plan to move into the mainstream of the Negro
Revolution was cut short by a hail of assassins' bullets, a man who
felt certain he would not live long enough to see this book appear.

"In the agony of this brilliant Negro's self-creation [is] the agony
of an entire people in their search for identity. No man has better
expressed his people's trapped anguish." —The New York Review of Books
